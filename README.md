# **OptiMUS**: Optimization Modeling Using mip Solvers and large language models


This repository contains the official implementation for the following three papers (you can use branches to access the other versions):


- V0.1: [OptiMUS: Optimization Modeling Using mip Solvers and large language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06116).

- V0.2: [OptiMUS: Scalable Optimization Modeling with (MI) LP Solvers and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10172).

- V0.3: [OptiMUS-0.3: Using Large Language Models to Model and Solve Optimization Problems at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19633)

## NLP4LP Dataset

You can download the dataset from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/udell-lab/NLP4LP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/udell-lab/NLP4LP). Please note that NLP4LP is intended and licensed for research use only. The dataset is CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes.
